This app demonstrates and test how to delete a row by a swipe left gesture.
- iOS natively provides this feautre, but android does not
- this app includes a library (swipeToDelete.js) that emulates this gesture

Usage:
- simply add the following line to your table creation code:
    require('swipeToDelete').emulateRowDeleteEvents(table);
- and add an event handle for custom actions on delete:
    table.addEventListener('delete', function(e) {/*do some thing*/});

Testing:
- tests can be run with 'tishadow --platform=android spec'
  some test are not stable on android (problems relate to the event system)
- tests run smoothly on iOS : 'tishadow --platform=ios spec'
  but use the iOS native fuctionality in the real app.
- calabash acceptance test (currently iOS only): bash ios_calabash.sh

Note:
- redrawing of the table after swipe/delete gestures is not always working
  maybe this is only a problem on the simulator.
  currently the table is forced to redraw with a hide/show combo,
  which might give some flickering artefacts.
